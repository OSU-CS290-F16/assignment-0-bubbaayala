            It was not to difficult to get started since I had some basic knowledge of html. However I did struggle with using the <br/>
            image tag and linking an image in my index which I solved by using online articles which used step by step guides on how <br/>
            to do so. Along with linking an image I also learned how to create a link to other files I have created. Because of this <br/>
            assignment I learned how perform a number of new tasks.
